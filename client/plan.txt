- Login page:
  - similar to register, copy paste and make changes
  - get form input from user and post to backend for authentication

- Profile page:
 - show user information

- Protected routing:
  - install redux for to manage state of cookie and use for protected routing
  - create store
  - create slice
   - create reducer with boolean to change loggedIn state
  - provide store for app with Provider

- Persist state of isLoggedIn over refreshes: 
 - Local storage set middleware when calling reducer
- Refresh token:
 - call refresh route on a set interval so that token does not expire and can be refreshed

ISSUES:
-REFRESH TOKEN:
 - when user logeed in and refresh token working, if changing to contact route,
 the refresh is not called --> the cookie expires.
--resolved:
 - put user state in the redux state so it is available from contact page
 - if user is loggedin and goes to contact page, keep calling the refreshtoken

 - verify email on Register
 - reset password password
 - Make blog API
 
 re/verify user
 - add isVerified to schema

  2. check if email with account exists, user is already verified?
  3. send verification email


08/11/2022 Blog page

// Blogs page (user and admin)
// create blogSlice
// use createAsyncThunk to GET all blogs from blogs api
// create initialState type for Blog
// Get all blogs /api/blogs
// Add search bar (later)

// Admin has a dashboard -->
