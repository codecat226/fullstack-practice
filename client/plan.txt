- Protected routing:
  - install redux for to manage state of cookie and use for protected routing
  - create store
  - create slice
   - create reducer with boolean to change loggedIn state
  - provide store for app with Provider

- Persist state of isLoggedIn over refreshes: 
 - Local storage set middleware when calling reducer
- Refresh token:
 - call refresh route on a set interval so that token does not expire and can be refreshed

ISSUES:
-REFRESH TOKEN:
 - when user logeed in and refresh token working, if changing to contact route,
 the refresh is not called --> the cookie expires.
--resolved:
 - put user state in the redux state so it is available from contact page
 - if user is loggedin and goes to contact page, keep calling the refreshtoken
